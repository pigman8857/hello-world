# hello-world
First time try

I am the bone of my sword 
 Steel is my body and fire is my blood 
 I have created over a thousand blades 
 Unaware of loss, Nor aware of gain 
 Withstood pain to create weapons, waiting for oneâ€™s arrival 
 I have no regrets. This is the only path 
 My whole life was unlimited blade works
